S.O.F.I.E. Wellness OS — System Blueprint
----------------------------------------
This file is a living guide and reference for the core philosophy, architecture, and design principles of the S.O.F.I.E. system. Refer to this whenever making architectural or behavioral decisions for the AI, backend, or frontend.

Key Principles:
- Regulation before reasoning
- Consent before computation
- Enoughness over optimization
- Slow paths are first-class paths
- Silence is valid data

Architecture:
- LLaMA-powered cognition (Python)
- Wellness & sustainability logic engine
- Context-aware environment interface
- Consent-first data architecture
- JavaScript app (web/mobile) for humans
- Event-loop based on regulation, not productivity

See the full system vision in this file for reference.
